#### 1. Navigation flow and Accessibility
The navigation flow uses a drawer as the main entry point, with a tab navigator nested inside to handle the core sections like Home, Search, and Library. From the drawer, certain routes such as Profile redirect into the corresponding tab screen to keep the bottom navigation consistent. Each screen is given a clear, unique name to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth routing across layouts. Accessibility is supported through React Navigationâ€™s built-in roles for tabs and drawers, along with proper labels and color contrasts for icons.
